Angular SVG Icon
=========

The **angular-svg-icon** is an Angular 4.3+ service and component that provides a
means to inline SVG files to allow for them to be easily styled by CSS and code.

The service provides an icon registery that loads and caches a SVG indexed by
its url. The component is responsible for displaying the SVG. After getting the
svg from the registry it clones the `SVGElement` and the SVG to the component's
inner HTML.

A [working demo](http://czeckd.github.io/angular-svg-icon/demo/) shows solution in action.

## How to use?
```
$ npm i angular-svg-icon --save
```
(**Note:** For use Angular 2.4 through Angular 4.2, please install angular-svg-icon@4.2.6
and see the module's accompanying README.md for instructions.)

## Integration

The **angular-svg-icon** should work as-is with webpack/angular-cli. Just import the
``AngularSvgIconModule`` and the ```HttpClientModule```.

```typescript
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { AngularSvgIconModule } from 'angular-svg-icon';

@NgModule({
    imports: [ HttpClientModule, AngularSvgIconModule ],
    ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```
## Usage
Basic usage is:
```html
<svg-icon src="path/to/icon.svg"></svg-icon>
```
An example of styling the svg:
```html
<svg-icon src="images/eye.svg" style="fill:green;width:90px;"></svg-icon>
```

Programatic interaction with the registry is also possible.
Include the ``private iconReg:SvgIconRegistryService`` in the constructor:
```typescript
constructor(private iconReg:SvgIconRegistryService) { }
```

The registry has two public functions: `loadSvg(string)` and `unloadSvg(string)`.

To preload a svg file into the registry:

```typescript
{
   ...
   this.iconReg.loadSvg('foo.svg');
}
```

To unload a svg from the registry.

```typescript
{
    ...
    this.iconReg.unloadSvg('foo.svg');
}
```

## SVG Preparation
The SVG should be modified to remove the height and width attributes from the file
per Sara Soueidan's advice in "[Making SVGs Responsive With
CSS](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/08/19/making-svgs-responsive-with-css/)" if
size is to be modified through CSS. Removing the height and width has two immedate
impacts: (1) CSS can be used to size the SVG, and (2) CSS will be *required* to 
size the SVG.

## Background

The svg-icon is an Angular 5 component that allows for the continuation of the
AngularJS method for easily inlining SVGs explained by [Ben
Markowitz](https://www.mobomo.com/2014/09/angular-js-svg/) and others. Including
the SVG source inline allows for the graphic to be easily styled by CSS.

The technique made use of ng-include to inline the svg source into the document.
Angular 2 dropped the support of ng-include, so this is a work-around technique.

*Note:* The [icon
component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular2-material/icon) from
[angular/material2](https://github.com/angular/material2) used to have a direct
means to load svg similar to this, but this functionality was removed because of
security concerns.
